This is a simple inventory management system ideal for a small business.
It allows users to create, read, update, and delete products within the inventory.
All interaction with the program is done through the command line interface when the project is run.

To execute, simply run main.py either through the IDE of your choice or through the terminal by executing `python main.py` while located in the corresponding directory.

Interact through the CLI by entering any of the numbered options and following the instructions on screen.

main.py was primarily generated by Copilot by simply pasting the essential instructions from the Module 2 Assignment page to ensure that all necessary elements of the project were included.
